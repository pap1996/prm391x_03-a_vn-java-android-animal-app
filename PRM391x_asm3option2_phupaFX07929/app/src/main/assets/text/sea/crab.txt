Crabs are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton, composed primarily of highly mineralized chitin,[4][5] and armed with a pair of chelae (claws). Crabs vary in size from the pea crab, a few millimeters wide, to the Japanese spider crab, with a leg span up to 4 m (13 ft).[6] Several other groups of crustaceans with similar appearances â€“ such as king crabs and porcelain crabs are not true crabs, but have evolved features similar to true crabs through a process known as carcinisation[7][8][9][10]
